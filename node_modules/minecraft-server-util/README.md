A Node.js library for Minecraft servers that can retrieve status, perform queries, and RCON into servers. It uses modern Minecraft protocols to support the latest servers and also includes backward compatibility for older versions. This library supports both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition servers, as long as the correct method is used.

&#9888; **Future Deprecation Warning** &#9888;

Please note that this library will be deprecated in the near future due to issues with unreliable networking in the Node.js standard library. It is recommended that you use my other service, [mcstatus.io](https://mcstatus.io), as it has been extensively tested for all Minecraft versions, does not rely on your network, and uses the well supported REST API for implementing it in just about any application. You may still use this library as it *should* work as well, but no support will be provided.
